## Introduction

Flitr is a flight-booking system that aims to be easy to use for both the end
users and the administrators.

The goal of Flitr is to make the flight booking process as simple as possible
for all involved and to provide an alternative to the mainlne systems currently
in use. Sites like [expedia.com](https://expedia.com) and
[booking.com](https://booking.com) have too much clutter involved. We believe
that a system that books flights should do just that, **book flights**. We
want to remove the excess options that are often not used.

For the administrators of Flitr, we also wanted it to be as light-weight as
possible to make it easy to run on just about any system imaginable. The
same is true for the end user too, you don't have to worry about it
stealing all of your resources.
