## Introduction

This document describes the specification for Flytr, a flight booking system.
The goal of Flytr is to be light-weight, easy to use, and the best at one
thing: booking flights. Many flight booking sites have expanded to the point,
where they not only handle flights, but hotel reservations, cruises, and
rental cars. This "clutter" leads to many features not being used on the
website and therefore wasted space.

Flytr aims to solve this problem by making every feature and part of the
system designed to make the flight booking experience for the end user
the best that it can be. Adminstrators and maintainers of Flytr should
not have to worry about making a lot of mediocre systems when a single
well-made feature can be used.
